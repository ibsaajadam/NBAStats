## General info
When the most recent NBA playoffs were going on, I thought this would be a cool project to start using React.js. Though it isn't connected to an API for the stats, I did think that would be a cool feature to implement in the future. I used TailwindCSS because I felt that it made styling the site a lot easier and allowed me to focus more on React. 

The site opens up with a list of NBA players displayed on individual cards. The player cards rotate 180 degrees to display each NBA players career stats along with their individual teams, height and age. You can also search for an individual player with the search field at the top. 

Would like to add additional players down the road.
